We conducted a survey - A Greener Lifestyle [Responses](https://github.com/Prithvi-Extension/prithvi/blob/main/details/A%20Greener%20Lifestyle.pdf) in which we discovered that the most common reasons to not buy sustainable products was that they were not easily available, and that they were expensive. Other frequently cited reasons were that there simply werenâ€™t enough options, or that people were not aware of these options. Our extension is a one stop solution to all these problems. The response we received to our idea clearly demonstrates the need for a product like ours.
